\begin{document}

\maketitle

You can use this template in the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Replace the content of \texttt{template.tex} with your content. To change the file names in the output, rename:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{template.tex} to \texttt{NAME.tex},
      \item \texttt{template-sans.tex} to \texttt{NAME-sans.tex} (and adjust its content),
      \item \texttt{template-sans-large.tex} to \texttt{NAME-sans-large.tex} (and adjust its content).
  \end{itemize}
  \item Add \LaTeX{} files to the same folder containing \texttt{template.tex}. Any files containing the string \verb|\documentclass| (even commented out) will be compiled separately. You may delete \texttt{template.tex} and accompanying \texttt{sans} and \texttt{sans-large} files if you are not using them.
\end{enumerate}
In all cases, consult \texttt{template.tex} for how to use more advanced BookML functionality (such as providing large print PDFs or setting additional PDF and SCORM metadata).

\bigskip

For use with Overleaf (requires paid account):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Upload the template to a new Overleaf project. Ensure that the \texttt{.github} folder is also included.
  \item From the Overleaf menu, sync the project with a new (private) GitHub repository. After one or two minutes, you will receive an email announcing that the repository has a new a release containing the various BookML outputs. Follow the link in the email to download them.
  \item Every time you sync your Overleaf changes to GitHub, a new build will start and generate a new release.
  \item For a moderate speed up, change the \TeX{} Live scheme in the file \texttt{.github/workflows/bookml.yaml}. This will download smaller \TeX{} Live images containing fewer packages.
  \item If the build is cancelled, increase the timeout in the same file. See the \href{https://github.com/vlmantova/bookml-action}{BookML action documentation} for more details.
\end{enumerate}
